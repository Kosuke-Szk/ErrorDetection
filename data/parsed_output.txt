0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The reason I enjoyed it very much is that I could meet the vocalist on setting chairs just before they started practicing .

0	0	0	0	Dear M. Smith ,

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Two weeks ago , I spent a week in your fabulous city of London with my friend .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	On Thursday , the 3rd of May 2000 , we went to your theatre to see " Over the rainbow " .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Unfortunately , we were really disappointed about everything in the theatre .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Firstly , we got our tickets in your ticket office just one hour before the show .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We thought , as usual we do in London theatre , we could have discounts as it 's written on your advertisement .
1	0	0	0	0	1	0	Surprisily , there were no discounds .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secondly , the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 , it 's a theatre but not a concert hall ! ! ! !
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	Thirdly , we were astonished about the actors whose we know from others musical .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	Why did you not change the name of your advertisement ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	In the end , the restaurant was closed because you did n't have enough staffs , this evening ! !
1	1	1	0	Nothing was serious .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We really like London , the people , the night-life but this evening was really awful .
0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I sent to you a copie of our tickets .
0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	Would you pleased return our money back .
0	0	0	0	0	0	In advance , thank you .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	I hope we are not the only people to be so upset , but it was the first and the last time that I came in your theatre .
0	0	Sincerely yours
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	When her best friend , Scala , asked her an idea to surprise her husband because she 's pregnant , Pat put her feets in the plate just before Scala 's husband got the surprise .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	The problem is that Pat works in the Neubathin a little village .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She 's a secretary in an office .
0	0	0	0	Everybody knows everybody .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Pat and Scala have been good friends for 10 years , their husband too .
0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	It was a Friday suny afternoon , Scala was really excited to tell her the new .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	Despite she knew that Pat could n't keep secret but for this time she was confident maybe too .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	Just after Scala told her the new , Pat phoned her mother who worked in a bakery , to tell that Scala is pregnant .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As usual , Jon , Scala 's husband came & bought the bread for the evening .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	Pat 's mum was so excited about the baby , she just said " Congratulations for the new baby . "
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	He was so amazed and asked to repeat .
0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	She just thought it would be a secret , she came really embarassed .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When he went back to his house , his wife gave him the box with the shoes but it was n't a surprise !
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Scala was hungry with Pat because she thought she can keep this kind of secret .
0	0	0	Sir manager ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	I am writing in order to complain about what you have written in the advertisement on the newspaper .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am disappointed because of the horrible evening I have had , I was on holiday in London and I did not have time enough to spend there , but when you said that show was the best I decided to go .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	When I bought my ticket I asked for a discount and they said it was not available .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	At first it was not a problem because if the show was going to be the best it would cost what they said .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I arrived at the theatre in time and the musical show started later than I expected so I was getting nervous because I dislike very much the impuntuality , but that was not all .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	When the show started the person who was acting it was not Danny Brook and he seemed not to be an actor .
0	0	0	0	0	Really he was bad .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Afterwards I decided to go for a meal in the theatre restaurant but It was closed .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So you can imagine how I felt because of the irritating evening out I had .
0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	I am letting down because of your behaviour .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You wanted to cheat me , so I will be very pleasure if you could give my money back .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	I am looking forward your answer .
1	0	0	Your faithfully ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	I think technology has changed my life and the way of living of almost all people around the world .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all technology is very useful nowadays but really I dislike it because in some ways we are becoming machines too .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	Since the creation of PCs , people - and me too , of course - are making different things .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	For example we can buy food , clothes and whatever we need by internet or by telephone .
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I can know what is happening in differents parts of the world in a few minutes .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	A very good point of this change is that women have more freedom to have a job because before reaching the technology they have to stay at home doing housework but now we have laundries and a lot of machines like microwave oven .
1	1	1	0	0	0	0	In my case I dislike computers .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	I do n't know how to use them but I know I have to change because they help us to make our lives easier .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	On the other hand what will happen with us in the future ?
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	Our life will be managed by robots and they will replace us in our jobs .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So , what are we going to do ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Something that I note about technology is that we are loosing green places and there are a lot of pollution , so we have to be careful .
0	0	0	0	Dear Mr. Ryan ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	I received your letter and I am very glad I have won a two weeks travel to Camp California .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will give you some information which helps you to know me better .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I would like to travel to camp in July because this is the best time for me and I hope for you .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	I will be very busy in June so let me tell you some details about my travel .
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	About accommodation , I think tents would be great .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Basketball and swimming I think are the best for the children .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	Basketball will help children to build team character and leadership .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	And swimming is very good for health .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	I swim really good and I am a proffesional basketball player .
0	1	1	0	0	0	I count on my experience .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And there are few questions I would like to ask .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	First , what clothes should I take with me , secondly. how much money and by cash or by travel cards .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was the happiest moment of my life .
0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He asked me was the cheeseburger hot and I answered that it was .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was very nervous talking with him .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	He told me about concert programme and gave me his photo with a sign .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I will never forget that summer day .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was there , I saw it .
0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	I hoped that it , just could see 3 people , but it was mistake ...
0	0	0	0	Pat saw it !
0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We spoke with Pat many times to keep this secret , not to tell anyone .
0	0	0	0	We trusted him .
1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	At first several days , Pat all the time was with us .
0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	He promised to keep secret , in the next morning we had arguiment with Pat , 3 of us were shouting at each other , in shorter Pat went away from us .

0	0	0	Dear Kim ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I 'm writing to you to relate my experience in helping at a pop concert last month .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all , I would like to tell you that I 've never had a such good time in my life !
0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	The day one consisted in surrounding the festival 's place with fences .
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	The second day objective was to install the scene , with lights , loudspeakers and all stuff .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	This job was quite hard , but we took enough time to be not exhausted !
0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	The last day , in fact the concert day was absolutely fantastic .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	The public was so excited to see the concert that we had to place some bouncer front of the scene , to avoid the people coming on the concert floor .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	Finally , the concert was exactly that the people were expected .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I hop that the next time you will come with me !
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	I 'm looking forward to hearing your impressions about this !

0	0	0	Dear Clark ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am writing to you because I would like to give my personal opinion about the ' international arts festival . '
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all I have to say that the whole festival was a greatful success and I also think you chose an appropriate title for the leaflet .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	However , there are some points which can be improved for the next year .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	To begin with , you wrote down in the leaflet that stars and artists from around the world could be seen in the performance in fact their were only six countries involved .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My suggestion for this point is to invite more people from different countries .
0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Furthermore is that some concert halls were definitely to small or in other words to many people attended those concerts .
1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	This kind of problem you could avoid when you look for big halls at the begining .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Another point where you could improve is when you show more plays and films next year .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nearly at the end of this letter I have to say that the idea with the weekend ticket was really good because it gave to the people the opportunity to attemp a whole weekend for a cheap price .
0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	To finish this letter with I would like to give you a good idea for next year .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In my opinion it would be nice if you create an exhibition place where the guests can try to play different instruments .
0	0	Yours sincerely
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How can you earn money in your spare time ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think everybody will ask himself this question one day or has already asked it .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Anyway the people where asked this question probably found out that it is n't so easy to earn money or that it is sometimes to much work .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A traditional way to earn money , in the spare time , is to bring newspapers or magazines to the families in your town or village .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The problems that you have here is the weather .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	For example when it is rainy , because then everything get wet .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	Another suggestion is that you go to your cinema and ask if they need your help for changing the film rolls , for cleaning the toilets or to do some other small jobs .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But in the case that you really want to do some interesting work in your spare time you should try to sell something where you 're good at , I mean if you 're interested in computers you should try to provide your service for other people .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Of course in the begining it is hard but you can learn a lot and if you 're good at you 'll also earn some money .
0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	Okay do n't wait , there where you 're good at and begin .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	I noticed that the artists were from only six countries insted that from around the world .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	This choice does n't give many artists the possibility to expresse themself .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Some concert halls were too small and often people could n't see the performances .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There were many events that I think there were a few plays and films .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	Maybe it would be better put more of them in the programme because they like so much to young people .
1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	The very about young people , the choice to offer a reasonably-priced weekend ticket is a excellent idea because it brings them to have a contact with all what it art .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	I hope that my opinion can help you to set fro the next year a great internation arts festival alone to young people .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	I think a good way to get money it 's work in a fast-food .

0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I worked eight hours every day but in every fast-food you can work part-time , four , three , six hours every day .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It depends on what you need .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	This kind of job is perfect for the young people who want get money and in the meantime they have to study .

0	0	0	0	0	0	Shopping is not always enjoyable .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	I think this topic is so exciting in the antropological and psicological point of view , because we can studie the reaction before , during and after to shopping .
0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	People in general have a compulsory actitud for shopping in my opinion .
0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	Because sometimes the article for to buy is not really necessary .
0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	We must to accept that media have so important effect in our life in special the T.V .
0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	For the men and women is important the appearance and they spent a lot of money in buy clothes , cosmetic , accesories , jewels etc. And the other they choose sometimes just for the label .
1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	Without give really importance to the calidad in reference to the appearance there is more preocupation in the food area , because people in general they do n't spent the time for prepare food and when they shopping they choose pre-prepared food .
0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	We know is more easy for these busy life .
1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	In the other hand the facilities for access to mall center is not good .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	The area for parking , space for play grown to the children or bus station near the mall is not really appropiate .
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Otherwise shopping will be more enjoyable .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think in the nearly future we need to decide with the goverment. which is special place in the town we lefet just for comerical area , but of course with all the facilities to get there like a big supermarket , and mall centre in different areas of the city .
0	0	0	DEAR SIR ,

0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	IN ADITION TO THIS , I DID NOT HAVE ANY DISCOUNT IN MY TICKET .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	SO , I HAD TO PAY A LOT OF MONEY TO SEE A PLAY THAT WAS A COMPLETELY DISASTER .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I THINK THAT IT WAS THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	They breathe , eat , feel and beside that they are famous they are just the same as anyone else .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	Nobody likes to be observed constantly or touched by strangers and pointed out in the streets with no right even or just a little privacy .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	I personally think the best would be to put the celebrities in cages and let people touch them , point and ask for authopraps .
1	0	0	0	0	Like in the zoo .
0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The biggest commercial gain in history I believe , but celebrities are not animals although they may be sometimes treated the same way .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	On the other hand , they must have done something to become famous .
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	It may in many cases , not be true but we can suspect that most of them wanted to become a celebrity and they had to know there is no private life unseparately contected to it .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	To sum up , I believe that everyone has the right to keep privacy of their own homes and even someone extremely famous deserve to have a private life .

0	0	0	0	Dear Jane Clark ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	The purpose of this letter is to congratulate you on the International Arts Fesival I attended last weekend .

0	0	0	0	To Mr Robertson ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	Firstly , I would like to thank you for the programme that you provided .
0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	It was very good programme , especially the river trip to Greenwich , which I am sure the whole class would enjoy .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	However , our class has spotted an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and would all wish to attend .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on the 14th March .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It will be from 10.00 till 7.00pm .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	The show will be about all the latest fashion , leisure and sports wear , make up and hairstyles .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We would also not have to worry financially as it is free for students .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	This will be a great opportunity for us because we will be able to find out more about the people of London and their fashions and style we might also get a change to meet new people and interest with them .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	The whole class is also very excited about this fashion show and would really appreciate your giving them a change to go .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have a few suggestion on how the programme could be changed to fit the London Fashion and Leisure Show in .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We could do as planned for Monday and move going to the Science Museum from Tuesday to Wednesday afternoon .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We would have to forgo the shopping as we might not have enough time and the exchange rate might be too high for us to do much shopping .
0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We can however go and look around the shopping mall if we have time after the show .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Lastly , I would be very grateful if you could give us your permission to go to the show .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I hope you would consider this matter .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I look forward to hearing from you .
0	0	0	Yours sincerely ,
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	Everyday , something changes and we become more modern companies use computers instead of books , dentist use modernized electrical item instead of just a plier , even homes are effected .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	From letters to emails , from gas stoves to electric stoves and microwaves , but we are n't just going to stop here are we ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No , in the future , the present will be the past and these things now new to use will be old , outdated and changed .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I see a very different home for us in the future .
0	0	0	0	0	0	Most things will be computerised .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We might even be using voice identification and fingerprints instead of keys .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	We an on and off lights with touch pads and remote controllers .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	We might even be able to open the door without getting out from the living room .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Cameras will be something usual in every house instead of that little peephole in your door .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Although all that may change our houses may be still the same .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The rooms and size should remain as it was and the living rooms and all may still be decorated in the same style .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	We might still favour that old carpet and couch .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	The furniture should not change that much on the outside and the amount of rooms should not change too .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In the future , every child might have a laptop .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And instead of going to school , why not let school come to you ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	We will be learning at home using computers and disc .
1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Never have to leave the house or wake up so early .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	Another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilitles we are using .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	We might not need maids to do housework anymore as they can easily be replaced with a robot , a machine , or something other with the same purpose .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Our homes will still be the same in terms of the kitchen , it will still be filled with vegetables and meat .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	This is because people wo n't miss the great taste of food although it could be subsituted to a vitamin pill or two .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	Lastly , I think that all this changes wo n't really be noticed as we change it daily and slowly instead abruptedly .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	People will be able to adjust and change with the times .
0	0	0	0	Dear Mr Robertson ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	On behalf of our class I would like to give you some information about the London Fashion and Leisure show , that we saw advertised and we are interested indeed .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	In addition we would like to thank you about the programme .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Firstly , I would like to give you some details about this show .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	It will take place in Central Exhibition Hall , in London , on Tuesday 14th of March and the suitable time will be 10.00 - 19.00
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I would like to mention that this day we are going to visit the Science Museum in the morning and after we are going for shopping , so I believe it will be a good change for all of us to attend this show as it is free for students !
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The most important thing is that the time that the show starts is perfect and is suitable as well with our programme because until 19:00 I think that everyone will have finished their shopping .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	Secondly , I would like to give you more details about the show and particularly what does it include .
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The latest fashion will be on show and also the Leisure and sports wear .
0	0	0	Really interesting !
0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	Moreover all about the make up and the hairstyles .
0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	I think that it will be a great opportunity to all of us to be on this show while we are going to be in London .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But , if there is a problem that the show is on Tuesday afternoon , the same hour with shopping , I suggest having the shopping on Wednesday afternoon that we will not have anything to do !
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I look forward to your reply ,
0	0	0	Yours sincerely ,
0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Some people think that to be a famous person is very excuiting thing , that all the time this makes you feel completely and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well .
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	I believe , that if somebody wants the fame and the glory must be tottally sure about the results .
0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	For example , the politicians the have choosed their careers , they must know that they are going to involved with everything that it has to do with publicity and their country and the most important is that they have to realize that they should be extremely careful of their movements or else they are going to have bad reputation , and they will be not trustworthy .
1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	Another succesfull carreer such as , film stars must also be balanced .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If somebody is a film star this mean that has got a different kind of life , more comfortable , more interesting but it does n't mean that he or she ca n't be like normal people even if he or she is a star .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If somebody wants to be famous of cource must be on the top and the mass media will be following him or her .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	But I think that the are limits .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Everybody deserve to have a private life even if he is a plumber or even if she is a famous singer .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	It does n't matter what kind of carreer or job you are follow .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	You must control your behaviour and try not implove so much yourself .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	And finally the journalists the should know how to respect the private life of everyone and not trying to make money for a living by using the reputation of the famous people .
0	0	0	0	Dear Mr Robertson ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	Firstly , I 'm writing to thank you the great opportunity you give us , especially in planing all this programme in a such acurate way .
0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think that this programme has a good organisation , as you know , due to we have enough time to visit plenty of local interest points .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It takes place on Tuesday 14th and begins at ten o'clock .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In this way , we can go to visit the Science Museum earlier in the morning and the , we can go to the show .
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Front my point of view , we are very interested in the latest fashions like the leisure , sports wear , make up , hairstyles , you know ...
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	I strongly believe that we will be at the right time and best city to appreciate it .

0	0	0	0	1	0	Oh I forgot about it !

0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	We will be able to accelerate the process of the computer 's games for example ...
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	But not in the strange way you can imagine ... I mean I do n't think we 'll change cars by aereoplanes ...
1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	In this way , you have to be calm because as you know the things are developing in the same way you'r changing , too .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	I 've always loved music so working in a concert was great .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	My work consisted in checking the tickets , the number on them and taking the people to their seats .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Sometimes I think that people never grow up , if they had been a class of children , they would have made less noise ! !

0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	Why people like so much go shopping ?

1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Othrewise , there are people who think the opposite ; such as : children , teenagers , men ; but not always , because they go to buy hardly ever , only when they need clothes or something for their job or school .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	In that way shopping can be as funny as you want , although if you do it very often , it will be as an obligation in the future .
0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	To sum up , all you make in small cuantities is good and funny , but do n't encrease them if you do n't want to feel uncomfortable .

1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	On one hand nowadays if we have to travel to Paris and return in the same day you can take a plane without any problem .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In the past it was impossible to go to Paris from Barcelona and come back in one day .

0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have asked to write a composition regarding the questionit is believed that shopping is not always enjoyable .
1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	In fact , to do shopping can be some disavantages for different reasons :
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Firstly , you have to queue for a long time to get a free cabin and waste of time putting on some clothes and in the end they are not the right size .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secondly , it is easy to spend a lot of money in few minutes and as soon as you can regret to buy all these clothes , which you do n't really need .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thirdly , some clothes can have some stains on and you have n't noticed this before buying , so you have to go back to the shop .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	However , it is not easy to get a refund or to change them .
0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In my opinion , doing shopping bring me a lot of satisfaction especially I am depressed , nevertheless it could be very dangerous for my wallet .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I 'm writing to complain about the service you 'd offered me last Saturday evening at The Circle Theatre .
1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	I 've read your advertisement and it did n't say the truth .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	There were n't any discount available as you 'd assured in the add .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	I think you should check the information before print it !
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	I arrived at the right time ( 19.30 ) that evening but the play , which was ' Over The Rainbow ' , started almost an hour later .
0	0	0	0	0	0	And nobody told me why !
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When the play began I realised that the main actor had been changed and the new one was n't good at all .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	I could n't visit the theatre after the performance because it was closed for reparations .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Why did n't you say something about it ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I did n't have the ' perfect evening out ' you 'd promised so I want to ask for my money back because your service was terrible .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	This is not a simple question because I got used to dealing with technology since I was a child but I 'm going to try to explain you how .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I did n't have a computer until I was eight .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Then my brother and I started to develop a new ability .
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	In that time I used the computer only to play with its video games .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When I was thirteen I discovered a completely different use for my computer .
0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	It became scencial to do my homework .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And years later it enabled me to get a very good job .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	One day my mother got a terrible disease .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She had to be operated on and my family and I were very scared .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But when we talked to the doctor we felt more relaxed because he answered us that the operation was a very simple one .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	I think that if my mother had got ill ten years before , she would n't survive .
1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	The modern technology is better now than what it used to be .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What do you think about this ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I 'm sure that these arguments have explained my point of view , have n't they ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now I would like to have your point of view .
0	0	0	0	Dear Mrs. Ryan ,
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	I 'm writing you in response to your letter , I was delighted to know that I won the first price .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	With reference to the date , I only can go on July , as I 'm going off on holiday on August , and I start university on September .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	The place I 'd prefer to stay in is a log cabin , where I 'm sure I 'd feel more confortable than in a tent .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It 's very nice of you to let me choose my favourite activities .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	The ones I 'm most keen on are Tennis , in which I think I 'm pretty good since I took some classes last year , and Painting , which is one of my favourite hobbies , and helps me to relax myself and forget about problems .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	I think I 'm not bad at painting either , at least everyone in my family likes my work , includying myself .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But the most exciting part was meeting the band , mainly the singer and the drummer who are very nice and also good-looking .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Anyway , I had lot of fun working for them .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I hope they call me soon , I 'd be the happiest girl in the world if I could see them again ...

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How many times have we heard people complaining about shopping ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	Sometimes , they are happy to do shopping. but why ?
1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Therefore , shopping can be enjoyable but it is not always the case .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	Shopping is enjoyable when you want to offer some thing to someone .
1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	In fact you try to get a present to make receive happy .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Shopping is also good , when you know what you want .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	For example if you want a new track suit you know that you have to go to a sport shop but if you do n't know what you want you are going to waste your time in the shops .
1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	In the opposite , shopping can be disenjoyable .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Shopping is boring if you go with people too fussy .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	That is to say , they are never happy with what they get and see .
0	0	0	0	0	0	They always find a problem .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Shopping is not enjoyable with people who just look around the shops .
0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is stupid , they do not have any goal .
0	0	0	0	0	They waste their time .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	To conclude , I agree with shopping is not always enjoyable .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	Even if I like to do shopping with some people and kind of shops I will kill myself because I waste my time .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	The star , the actor Danny Brook , there was n't in the musical show but there was an other actor , with my great disappoint .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Then , in the program I could read a discount available for the tickets , for the groups , but I could n't have that .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I could n't have all the things I expected .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	That evening was terrible for me and for my friends , so I 'm not satisfied about your informations and I ask some money back .

0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That might be a secret for Francis - and they decided the program and the present , a new gold watch .
0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	Peter and Sue asked to Francis some help for their exam 's subjets and Francis , for to help them , was very busy all the week .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	The last day all the friends went to Pat 's home with food , musical instruments , tape recorder .

0	0	0	Dear Sir ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	I went to your show called " Over The Rainbow " and I was really disappointing in many points .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Firstly , you spoke about two actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , instead of them we had two others and they were really bad .
0	0	0	0	0	0	So I was really surprised .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In addition to this you started the show 45 minutes late .
0	0	0	0	0	0	It was boring for everybody .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How could we appreciate the show properly .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Moreover , in your advert you spoke about discounts available but it was not the case .
0	0	0	0	0	No discounts were available .
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Then you offered people to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because there is no staff to welcome the people .
0	0	0	1	1	1	0	You offered something impossible to do .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	I did not have a good time for all of this reasons and I would like you to give my money back .
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I hope your understand my request and you are going to reply as soon as possible .

1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Because there was a man had a serious car accident and I was walking pass him .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I enjoy swimming and singing and I would like to join others in these activities .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	On the other hand everything looks different if I have to make a present for someone in my family .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	I start thinking what she or he prefer and I try my best buying something apropiate does n't matter how much money does it cost .

0	0	0	0	0	MAY 29 , 1997 .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	IT WAS MY FIRST TIME IN LONDON .
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	THAT NIGHT I WENT TO A PUB IN BAYSWATER .
0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	WHEN THEY CLOSED I TOOK THE 7 BUS .

0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	I TOLD HIM , I DID N'T KNOW WHERE I WAS BUT HE JUST SEID SORRY .
0	0	1	1	0	I WAS REALY SCARE .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE AROUN BUT I WAS AFRAID TO ASK THEM THE WAY I SHOULD TAKE .
1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	AT LEAST I ASKED A BOY AND HE SAID " I 'LL TELL YOU WHERE IS THE PLACE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR , JUST FOLLOW ME " .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	IT WAS DANGEROUS , BUT I KNEW I HAD TO DO IT .
1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	10 MINUTES AFTER I WAS FOLLOWING HIM , I START KNOWING THE PLACE , AND I WAS FELLING MORE CONFORTABLE .
0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	HE TOOK ME RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE .
0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	I THANK HIM SO MUCH , AND I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I ASKED TO THE RIGHT PERSON AND NOTHING WRON HAPPEN TO ME .
0	0	0	0	0	Dear Sir or Madam ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am writing in order to explain to you the problems regarding the musical show I saw at your theatre .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all , there was written in the advertisement for the show , that there would be Danny Brook as main actor , but a different actor played in the show .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	The show started forty-five minutes later and this really disappointed me .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Besides , when I bought the ticket , I found out there was not discounts for ticket , while you wrote the contrary .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Moreover , I could not go to the theatre restaurant because , by the time the show had finished , it had already closed .
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Definetely , it was a very disappointing evening and I would appreciate your if it was possible to have my money back .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future .
0	0	0	Yours faithfully ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She was a very pretty and kind girl , but she had this bad habit .
0	0	0	0	0	0	This was her only fault .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	She had a lot of friends but nobody trusted her .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	That was why she decide to change her behaviour .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	She was given a chance : if she had been able not to tell everybody a secret for a short time , her friends would have started trusting her .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	The secret was about a surprise-party for her bestfriend 's birthday .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	As soon as the arrangement for the party started , she began to feel nervous and anxious because she wanted to tell everything to her bestfriend .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	But , as the days went by , she was surprised because she realized she was getting used not to tell secrets any more .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The day of the party arrived and Pat succeeded in keeping the secret .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All her friends were amazed at her change and started trusting her at once .

1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	Pleas apologise me , but there were many mistakes and problems on the note you have made , which disappointed me very .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I thought that Dany Brook who is my favorite actor play in that show .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And I was really disappointed when I saw Jeremy Brook on the stage .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	Please , if you would be so kind and mind correct this mistake .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	I would be gratefull if you could correct too that show start at 20.15 not on 19.30 .
1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	Other thing was that there was no discounts available , and that the restaurant which I wanted to visit after the show was closed because of the main cooker sikness .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I would be very grateful if I could get my money back .
0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	That evening which should be my perfect evening out , was in fact very tireing and boring .
1	1	1	1	0	Apologise me for disturb .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It started a week before that day .
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Pat found the great place for the party called " Blue Box " .
0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	I made a beautifull invite cards for every Agatha friends with a sign " Do not tell Agatha about that , this is a suprise party for her , please keep the secret ! "
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Pat arranged great DJ and drinks .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	My friend and I made a perfect decoration with ballons and other party stuff .
0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	Everyone told us it was breath taking .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Everything was set ... the day and hour came .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	Agatha said that it was the greatest present she could ever get !
0	1	0	Dear Mr/Mrs ,
1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	I 've seen your festival and I would like to give you my suggestions to it .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	I must say that International Arts Festival is really great idea .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	And your last festival was very intresting too .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	But also there are some notes that you should improve in the next year 's festival to make it absolutelly wonderful .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all , you must invite artists and stars from more countries around the world , because there are people only from six countries .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think it can make your festival more popular .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Jazz , rock and classical concerts are amazing , but I think that some concert halls are too small , so not everybody can come .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Your dance shows are very beautiful , art exhibitions is something original and exciting .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And also it is very interesting to talk with writers .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think that one reasonably-priced weekend for all events is exellent idea because it is n't so Expensive as buying ticket to each event , and with this ticket you can visit everything you want .
0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	I hope you will continue to making your festivals .
1	0	0	Your faithfully ,
0	0	0	Dear Tom ,
0	0	0	0	How are you ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you for your last letter .
0	0	0	0	0	It was very interesting .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The question you asked me in it is very original too .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	I must say that rules are n't same in schools of our country .
0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	Every school has it 's own rules .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think that my school is very democratic and so there are very good relations between teachers and students .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are all very friendly in our class and we help to each other when we have a problem .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	So the main rule in our school is regarding theachers .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I 'm allowed to do many things at home .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	My parents are very kind , and they know that their son will do everything right .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	And the main reason Why our family is so friendly , it 's because we have n't go many rules .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	So , I think there is n't something I 'd like to change .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I hope everything is good in your family and your school .
0	0	0	Take care ,

0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Maybe the eason for that is very simple : lack of money ?
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It would explain , why some concert halls were simply too small - you just could n't afford bigger ones .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	On the other hand , the wide range of plays and films to choose impressed me most .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We do not have many school rules , and the teachers are rather liberal .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	We do n't have to wear any special uniforms on signs of our school .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Some rules are really simple : we must be at school on time , and we must not disturb others during the classes .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We are not allowed to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol of course !
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In winters we are to change our shoes .

0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	I am also used to write exams which are in polish schools very often .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	At home I do n't have many rules either .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I must wash the dishes from time to time ( I sometimes try to avoid this unpleasant duty ) and clean our house .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I do n't think there is anything I 'd like to change .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I 'm very pleased with my situation and I hope you are pleased with yours !

0	0	0	Dear Sir/Madam ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	I am writing to complain about the musical show .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Over the Rainbow , which you advertised .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I saw the show at your theatre with my friend on 6th June .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	However , I was disappointed with something which did not match your advertisement .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	First of all , I would like to have seen Danny Brook as I am keen on his play .
0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	He did not play in the evening .
0	0	0	0	0	It made me sad .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secondly , the starting time has been changed from 19:30 to 20:15 .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We waited for ages because we had not been informed .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In addition , although you advertised the discounts tickets available , they do not sale them any more according to your staff .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Finally , we went to the restaurant in your theater after the show .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	It was closed because of the staff trainning .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am sure you can understand my disappointment .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I must insist that you refund the cost of the show .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Unless I hear from you within ten days , I shall have to take legal advice on the matter .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I look forward to hearing from you in the near future .
0	0	0	Yours faithfully ,
0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	It is believed that our life style has been changed by mordern technology such as computers and washing machine etc. Especially for families .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	I have found very expensive to buy them but there are number of advantages .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all , dishwashers are very effecient for me because I work full time and look after my children .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is very difficult to cook and wash dishes after working .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Before buying my dishwasher I asked my son to wash them .
0	0	0	1	0	0	He complained about a lot .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	Secondly , computers are useful for us as well , because we do not need to go somewhere if we want to have information , for example traveling .
0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	However my family 's members do less communicate with each other than we used to , because my children are keen on playing computer games .
0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	In my opinion , the morden technology make our life style combinient .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is very good for us but I think we should think about more carefully when we buy something for our children .
0	0	0	Dear Sir/Madam ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I 'm writing to complain about my horrible evening at The Circle Theatre on 10th June 2000 .

0	0	0	0	0	It really disappointed me .
0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	After finishing the show I wanted to visit your restaurant and I found that it was closed .
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	It was a sign in front of the restaurant " sorry we closed because special reasons " and I was wondering what was the reasons for that .

0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The most appropriate month for me to travel is July because my boss promised to give me this month off ( I am in charge of project which starts in June so I am sure I could n't go later ) .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	As I have a choise I would prefer to stay in log cabins to tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so depended on weather conditions .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As I was requested I should choose two activities from the list .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I decided to choose climbing and photography .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	These two are easy to connect , I could climb and make pictures at the same time .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am very keen on photography .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Last year I took part in photograher 's contest and I won a second prize in Poland in cathegory of ,,beautiful scenery .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Climbing , in contrast , is something I started few months ago , so I have not gained any success in this sport .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	But you could give me a chance to get more familier with it .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I would like to ask about clothes .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Have you ever been to a big supermarket and tried to find something you really like or want , looking throug shelves and not finding that in the end .
0	0	0	0	0	What did you feel ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	You had to be disappointed .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	There is a lot of situations which could make you feel similar while you do shopping .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You might spend too much money and buy something you do n't really need .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	You could also buy something which later turns out to be out of order .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So you have to complain about it .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Very often a shop assistant is not helpful so you lose your money and your time .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Moreover , you could face an agressive and maybe even drunk shop assistant or manager .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	This leads to an escalation of your anger .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Sometimes you could find a bargain .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You are happy to buy a dress or a suit for a good price .

0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And you could n't of course give it back because the price was lowered and your dress is not under guarantee .

0	0	0	Dear Sir ,

0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was such disappointing evening out with my friend during our a week 's holiday in London .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	We have had a quite pleasant time except the evening .
0	0	0	0	0	0	Actually it spoiled our time .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So I would like to get back our money .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	These are some points I want mention about the differencies between the advertisement said and the realities .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First , I had a great expectation to see Danny Brook plays his role , but he had never shown up that night .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The main actor was an unknown actor .
0	0	1	1	1	0	It was a such disappointing .
0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	Second , it started only at 20:15 .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	It was 45 minutes later than it suppose to be .
0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was a such boaring to wait the show in a noisy and hot theatre .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	Third , there was no possibility of discount .
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The girl sold the tickets was laughing at me when I mention about the discounts availability was written in the advertisement .
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Forth , the theatre restaurant was closed .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	There was a not on the door saying that the painting was going on the weekend .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How could you arrange work like that ?
0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Finally the sentence was written blow down on the advertisement was absolutely not true .
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	It was most imperfect evening out I ever exprienced .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	I wish that you can provide a better service next time , and this time you need give back the money we paid .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	Since I moved to London to study English I have had a hard time to make intimate friendship with people around me .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First it was because of the culture difference .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	It took quite long time to adjust in the multi culture in the language institue .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secondly the language ability was another issue .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Even I could meet some friend , but I could n't express my heat to them for we have different back ground and our first language were different .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	I really wished to have a friend can share everything is going in our lives .
0	0	0	0	0	Finally I met Pat .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	One day she realized that I was always been outside of circle .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	One day she invited me to her flat .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	Since then we have visited each other often and spent time together in weekend usally .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	We had a fantastic time together for three monthes .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was like a dream come true , and was the best part of the experience in my opinion .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I helped out my friend by writing huge billboards and making some light refreshments .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	Despite the fact that I felt exhausted I must admit that it was one of the days I will never forget througout my life

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is also a suitable present for your cousin , I think .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	One story is about ten persons who stay together in a hotel on a lonely island .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	There is a storm and they can not leave .
0	0	1	1	0	Suddenly a murderer happens !
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Believe me , you would never guess who the killer is !
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	There is also Hercule Poirot , the famous detective and he finally solves the mistery .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	But I will not tell you more .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You have to read it yourself .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Unfortunately it is quite expensive , £ 32 .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	First of all , I think I would like to travel in July , which will be the only month for me to go .
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because my course wo n't finish until the end of June , and I will have to stay in the college to get ready for the new term .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Then I 'd like to choose the tents for my accommodation when at Camp California .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	I think sleeping in a tent is funnier than others .
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	However , during my stay at Camp , there are two activities I can choose , one of them I will choose Basketball because it is the sport I play most , I and my friend used to win the first place in school-wide match when we was in school .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	And the other one , I think painting will be a good idea ; Painting is one of my hobbies and I 've been learning it since I was 5 years old and now I 'm still doing it once I have free time .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	Above are all the information you asked , however , here are something I 'd like to know ; first is about the clothes , what kind of clothes I need to take with ?
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	And another question is what is the prices of things like in there , so that I can make a better buget of my trip .

0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	The place we worked was a football pitch ; we spent 3 days on setting up the stage , the equitment , and the lights .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In fact , there is nothing very important I did , because we are not the right people to do it .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	I only put the speakers in the right places , or helping engieners tested the lights .
0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	But at the brakes and after work , I had a chance to talk with the engieners , and I leant something about setting up the equitment .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	The fourth day , the singers and the players have been to there to test .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Then I had a chance to speak with them .

1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Regarding your advertisement , it is the LONDON 'S NEWEST AND BEST MUSICAL SHOW , but I was deeply disappointed at it .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	According to your advertisement , the starrings were DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	I decided to go to see this show because of its starrings , but at the day I saw it , a different actor played .
0	0	0	0	0	0	He was not DANNY BROOK .
0	0	1	0	0	1	0	Moreover there was no discount ticket .
0	0	0	0	0	0	They were all sold out .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	You should have said they were very few .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I had to buy a £ 20 ticket .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	To make matters worse , the time that the show started was delayed .
0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	It started at 20:15 , fourty five minutes later !
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That 's why I could n't have a dinner at the theatre restaurant after the show .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	It had already closed , when the show finished .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I 'd like to ask for a full refund for this awful night .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Could you give me a satisfactory reply as soon as possible .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Modern technology has changed my life .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	Before using e-mail , I used to write letters and sometime telephon .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	However I 've found e-mail is better than them .
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	Because as soon as I send my message , they can receive it .
1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	In the other word , I can also receive their reply soon .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	It 's really useful , when I need quick reply .

0	0	0	Dear Sir/Madam ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am writing to complain about the show , " Over the Rainbow " which I saw in your theatre last week .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was really disappointed because the show was far from what I expected .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all , I was really expecting to see Danny Brook , my favourite actor .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	However , he was not on the stage that day .
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	Secondally the show started late and I had to wait for 45 minutes without doing anything .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It was a waste of time .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	I also thought that there should have been discounts for students , which in fact was not available and I had to pay for normal price .
1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Furthur more , the restaurant in the theatre was closed after the show because of the delay .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I had to go home without eating a dinner , though I was really hungry .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I have to say that the evening was terrible .
0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	If I had known all of them , I would have changed my plan and could have a better time .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	I strongly suggest you should give us right information .
0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	I also would like to claim some refund for the evening .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	If you compare the fashion now with that of 100 years ago , you 'll notice that there are incredably big difference between them .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	People have become more informal , casual and practical than before .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But how about the fashion of the future , for example , 100 years from now ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think it 'll also be very different from now .
0	0	1	0	0	But in which way ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all , people might think more about the function of clothes than the design .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	For example , they 'll wear a cloth which protect themselves from air pollution , sunshine etc .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	It 's like a joke , but a bit scarely .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	Imagine that all the people have hats with big edges to protect their faces from sun-burn , and it 's the most trendy fashion of the year !
0	0	0	0	It 's funny .
0	0	0	0	0	0	But we never know ! !
0	0	0	Dear Sir/Madam ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I recently had a holiday in London and had been to your musical show ' Over the Rainbow ' but found it very disappointing .
0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	It is said that the singers are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove in the advertisement .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	However , there was a different unknown actor in that .
0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	The show started later at 20:15 which was very different in ' 19.30 ' as shown .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	There was no discount at all which is in contrast with ' Discounts Availabe ' .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	After the show , I wanted to have something in the theatre restaurant and found it was closed because of no reason .
0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	The real show on it owns is really very different to what are mentioned in the advertisement .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am unsatisfied and would like to ask for some money back .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	Please would you also change the advertisement to the level of the actual facts .
0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you for your attention .
0	0	0	Yours faithfully ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What will clothes be like 100 years from now ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is a very hard thing to predict .
0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	The fashion of nowaday clothings is just keep on changing .
0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	Although some may appears again after few years different styles are developed .
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	For the fashion of the future , I think it depends on the people 's own personalities and develope their own styles which suits them the most .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	They can wear different kinds of clothing , like they design for themselves or those like history can wear those of victorian time and in different countries .
1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	For the colours , I think the metalic colours , especially silver , will be the most popular .
0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	As different kinds of farbics will be invented & the clothings will never be just cotton as always been seen .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	Maybe paper can also be a farbic use for make clothings and for those who like to wear new clothes everyday .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	They can be thrown away after wearing it and light enough to be carried around whenever you want to change your wearing .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all , I would like to say that the only month available from me to travel is July .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	From my point of view , the real question is : Who said that is enjoyable ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Maybe for women , but not for me .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I know that this sounds horrible , but sometimes it 's what really happens .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	For men , sometimes is hard to go shopping with their partners .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Sometimes that means a complete tour around all the fashion shops in town .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	And of course , we are not allowed to stop in a place that we like .
1	1	1	0	The Sports Shop .
0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You cannot lose the time because all the other shops could be closed when you arrive .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And that is allways what we want .
0	0	0	0	0	0	That 's men 's intention .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	Another point is to go a big area .
1	1	0	Specially week-ends .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Everyone pushing a trolley and crashing around .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	People should have to take a license to drive those things .
0	0	0	0	0	Someone could be injured .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And of course , the time to pay .
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	A huge que that lasts half an hour or more and finishes with you completely freaked out .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In conclusion , for me to go shopping is not enjoyable at all .
0	0	0	Dear Sir ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I 'm writing to you inform you about the dissapointing evening I had when I went to your theather to see the play called " OVER THE RAINBOW " .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	According to the advertisement you gave , there have been some important differents .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Firstly , the play started almost an hour late , and I went there to see Danny Brook , but there was a different actor on stage .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	Secondly , in the advertisement the discounts are available but in the tickets I bought they were no discount .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	Furthermore , I had planned to have a great dinner with my family in your restaurant and it was closed because the people who work in were on holidays .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	Finally , I want to tell you that it is not useful for you and your theather to cheat to your customers .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you do it , there will be no bussiness for you and no satisfaction for them .
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I look fordwad to hearing from you

0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	How has modern technology change my daily life ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nowadays , technology is the most useful tool that human beings have .
0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	It affects everyone who live in this planet and every activity made in it .
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	In this case we are going to focus on me .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	In addition to this we use the net to comunicate with some friends we have in U.S.A. It 's really amazing .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Apart from this , I do n't spent my free time in technology .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I prefer playing rugby and going out with friends , because technology is not all life , but it is only a little part of it .
0	0	0	Dear Sir/Madam :
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am writing to ask about your advertisement and theatre show .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am a student in Liverpool , and recently I had a week 's holiday in London .
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First day in London , I saw your advertisement which was very interesting to me .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	But I was really disappointed it .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all , there was only one actor that was different from your advertisement .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	Also , it was certain to me to bought a discount tickets cause I am a student .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	But , it was not availiable .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Second , I went to the theatre exactly seven thirty in the evening .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	However the show started 45 minutes later .
0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	I wasted time too much for waiting .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	It was not good to me , cause I had only one week holiday in London .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Moreover the theatre restaurant was closed with the word " Stuff vacation " on the front door after the show .
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	It was absolutely different from your leaflet .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	On the whole , I was really disappointed at that time .
0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	Could you do me my half of money back .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I enclose my phone number and address .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .

0	0	0	0	0	Fashion of the Future .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Have you ever seen the film star wars ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And did you notice something about fashion of the future ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	I think the people will wear convenient clothes with simple design in the future .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Because the people will stay at home more than now with their computer .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	And they will use soft cozy cloths like cotton and silk .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	However , if they have some special day when like important public day or special day of their life , they will wear very different kinds of clothes which was you never seen before .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Some of that will be very strange to our eyes , but some of others will be familiar to us .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	And they will use the most kinds of things like small stone to diamond etc. Maybe some peoples are nakid .
0	0	0	0	0	0	It will be very interesting ...
0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	Just imagine the way of future people 's life .
1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And you can see the their clothes also .

0	0	0	0	Dear Mrs Ryan ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you very much for your letter .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	I was really surprised and very happy when I read that I have won the first prize .
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all because I have never been to California and second because it 's the first time I have ever won something .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The only time that is possible for me to travel is July , because I am working for a bank and this is the only month I can go on holiday .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	For my stay in California I would prefer the accommodation in tents because this gives me a feeling of freedom and adventure and it is quite different to my live here in Greece .
0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	The activities I would like mot to do are climbing and surfing .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	In my free time I have climbed a lot of mountains in the surrounding area so I can say , that I am quite good in climbing .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	But I have never ' surfed ' in my live , so that is an activity I have to learn .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Last but not least there are some things I would like to know : What kind of wheather do you have in California ?
0	0	0	0	0	Is it very hot ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What kind of clothes should I bring with me ?
0	0	0	0	0	And what about money ?
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	How much money Should I take with me ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Are there any activities which are not included ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And my last question : how many persons are going to stay in each tent .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I 'm looking forward to hearing from you soon .
0	0	Yours sincerely
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Many people , especially women , love shopping .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you go to the centre of every big town you will see people walking from store to store searching for something to wear or to buy to eat .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But shopping is not always enjoyable .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	First of all because of the big variety in the store .
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Very often you do n't know what to buy because we do n't have only three or four different sport shoes to choose from , not , we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as Nike , adidas or Fila .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	And very often you have to pay a lot of money for the product you want .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Another cause is that shops and stores are often overcrowded .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Very often you can hardly move because of the crowds of people .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	And many people are in a hurry , so do n't wonder if other people have not tolerance and patience to wait and hit you with their shopping cars .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Of course there are a lot of other causes why shopping is n't always great fun , but the last cause , which is very important for me is that shopping is becoming more and more impersonal .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	That means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores , where noone has time for you to show you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for me , no one to talk to and noone to complaine .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	That is the most important reason why I only like to go shopping in little stores , where I have peace and quiet and very often nothing to complaine about .
0	0	0	0	0	Dear Mrs Helen Ryan ,
0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was writting as reply of your letter , I am glad to have won the first prize in your competition for two weeks at Camp California in the USA .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	About the information that you need , I must tell you that I will be able to travel only in July becase I got a new job and I ca n't ask for more than one month holidays each year and on the other months I will be very busy becase my workmates will take holidays on these months .
1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	With the accomodation , I would prefered tents becase it is more according with a camp .
0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	And with the activities I must chose Photography and Painting becase I am not very good for sports and I think I am doing well in these things .
0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Finally I just ask you What kind of clothes do I have to bring with me , and around How much money do you think I will need .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Thank you very much for everything .

0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	And I was helping them fixing the last details .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	When the concert started I was preparing some drinks for the band because when the concert finished they were very tired and tersty .
0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	After the concert I only help with tidy up the place and made sure that everything was under control and clean .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Later the band was talking to me , I could get their new album free , and some other souvenirs from the band .
0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But the thing that particulary liked me was that I could do all kind of things just in one day and I could feel different emotions .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So , that 's everything that I can tell you , I enjoy a lot and I hope to have another experience like this .

0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	In the letter you said that accommodation provided can be either tents or log cabins .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	I would prefer to stay in tents so that I will have the chance to be in contact with the nature as well as the scenery around .
1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Another thing I would like to choose from the activity list is singing ( because I take part in a chorus at school ) and photography .

0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	I am writing to express my dissapointment about the play " over the rainbow " which is performing at Circle Theatre .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all , the advertisement for the show announced Mr. Danny Brook as the principal actor .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Surprisingly , he never appeared on the stage , during the play .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Therefore , the theatre or the company is lying .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	Secondly , the show started one hour fifteen past after .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We arrived at the theatre in time and we had to wait all that time until the show began .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Finally , when I asked about the discounts , an agressive employee refused to answer me .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	He stayed looking at me and laughing .
0	0	0	0	It was incredible .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	The evening was a horrible surprise , completely different from the promise written in the advertisement .
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Defineteley , I want my money back as soon as possible .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	I knew that but I would prefer to trust her so I told everything about Lynne Harter , our new collegue at school .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	However , I have to admit that I told her my own opinion .
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Well , it was the beginning of my tragedy .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	So , I told Pat that Lynne was ugly , fat like a cow , and extremely agressive .

0	0	0	Dear Sir ,
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I 'm writing to complain for the musical show " Over the Rainbow " .
1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I 've been recently seeing in your theatre during my week 's holiday in London I must say I had a very disappointing evening !
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was sure this was the London 's newest and best musical show I had ever seen because of the good publicity you made in your advertisement , but I thought completely wrong !
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Firstly , the play started nearly an hour later as I expected !
0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	If the spectacle has been beautiful , I would have been quite pleased to wait .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Then , I had read that there would have been discounts available , but it was n't true !
1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	So it 's better not to write anything if you do n't make it true then .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	Finally , I hoped that , after these incidents , I would enjoy myself , but there was another change of programme : starring !
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The main actor , Danny Brook , was changed and the one who played his part was n't as good as I expected .
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	Finished the show , I went to your theatre restaurant , but it was closed and this has n't been said before .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Moreover , I was shocked by the reason for which it was closed : the chef went away after he received a phone call !
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	For all these reason , I want to ask for my money back and I hope to hear from you soon !
0	0	0	A suggestion ?
0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Organize better your shows and do not exagerate with publicity !
0	0	0	Yours sincerely ,
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	There would be many things to say about .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Technology is a wide field which increases very quickly .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It 's creating an artificial world , where everything is electronic and fast .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	I 'm not sure if I must say technology has changed our life in positive or not .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Certainly , thanks to it , we can do things today that were impossible a few centuries ago .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nowadays , we make a phone call with an astonish rapidity , instead at my grandparents ' time it took one month or more to have contact with people abroad , because the only means of communication was the post and its service was very slow !
0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When appeared the first car , it was already a great success .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Before that , people travelled by horse or worse .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	Fortunately today everyone can take an aeroplane and go to America , Australia or wherever else he wants !
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	What can I say about the television ?
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	It allows us to keep connections with the other states of the world , improves our knowledge , offers us news , advises us about events which happened or will happen .
0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In the not very far 1914 , parent sent their sons in war and it was very difficult to know if they were still alive or dead !
0	0	0	0	It 's terrible !
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	Despite this , I 'm convinced all this progress caused some damages at the community , not only phisically .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We pay less attention to our life , to those things which give us happiness , that are n't money , success , power .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We became passive people , we follow the same routine every day and we live in a society where rules are strongly fixed .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think everyone should live his own life how he wants to live it and make him known for who he is , not for his money , but for his abilities , his good habits , his personality .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	Finally , everyone should decrease his own life 's rythm .
0	0	0	0	Mr John Smythe ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I 'm writing to tell you about the horrible evening I had on Friday .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	I was very excited with the idea of going to the theatre , but it did n't work out as I thought it will .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all the starring actors were supposed to be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove , Tina did act , but Danny Brook was replaced by an awful actor whose name I do n't recall .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Second of all , the play was suposed to start at 19:30 , but it started at 20:15 .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I 'm not used to waste my time sitting on a chair waiting , I do have better things to do with it .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Another thing I want to complain about , is that your advertised that discounts were available , but there was n't any discount at all .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	To finish my " marvelous " evening , I wanted to eat at your restaurant , but it was closed and no reason was given .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As I did n't have a " perfect evening out " , I think I have the right to ask for my money back .
0	0	0	0	0	I hope you understand .
0	0	Yours faithfully
0	0	0	Pat 's story
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Unfortunately , Pat was n't very good at keeping secrets .
0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Now you 've probably asking yourself what does it mean , well , now I 'm going to explain it to you .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Two years ago in this school , Pat and I used to be best friends .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We used to tell everything to each other .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	I was having some family problems , so my marks were getting down and down .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Pat was worried , she did n't know what to do .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	One day she looked me in the eyes with a sharp deep look , Never have I seen such a deep look : and asked me what was happening and I told her as I always used to .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	That afternoon she visited me and told me a plan she had designed to make my marks rise .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	It consisted in stealing the school list from the computer , in other words , hack the school software .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	I thought it was a great idea , so I stole about ten tests we were planned to do .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Pat could n't stand the pressure of the " crime " so she told the school directors that I stole the tests .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was punished , nearly expelt , but Pat did n't receive any punishment .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I never accused her of lying , and I you ask me why , I really do n't know .
0	0	0	Dear Sir/Madam ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I am writing to you after visiting your theatre .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Frankly speaking , I was very disappointed after my visit .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I was displeased from the very beginning , because I expected to get a discount as I 'm a student .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	According to your advertisment I could have one but in reality there were no discounts at all .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	But nevertheless I decided to go to your show .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	The show started t 20.15 instead of 19.30 .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	I had to wait in overcrowded hall .
0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	When finally the show had started I found out that Danny Brook was replaced by another actor .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	One of the reasons for my visiting your show was Danny Brook 's participance .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So , you could understand how disappointed I was .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	To make matters worse the restaurant which was mentioned in your advertisment was closed .
0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	So I had n't such perfect evening , as was promised in your advertisment .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In fact there were a lot of mistakes in your advertisment and I would be gratefull if you could give me back a part of my money .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I 'm looking forward to hearing from you .
0	0	0	Yours faithfully ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	How has modern technology changed your daily life ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	In my opinion , modern technologies play the important role in people 's life .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	I think that at present the most important technologies are computer and Internet technologies .
