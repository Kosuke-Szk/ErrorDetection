0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What would our world be without television ?
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	It is n't easy giving an answer at this question .
0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	Television is an important invention , it permitted us to better our way of communication .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	This animated box can give us a lot of informations coming from all around the world .
0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	Television has affected the all days life , , , too .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	We can spend a lot of time enjoying ourselves with some programs , all what we have to do is watching .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	And we like that , because it 's easier nothing doing than engaging ourselves in something that make us do something .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	So television can be a positive or a negative invention , it depends on which use we want to do of this box .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	Now we should be able to answer at the introducing question .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	No , I do n't think so .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	Television has become so important for us that we ca n't thinking that it could n't exist .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	To answer your last question , I would propose you to attend the local zoo , because many baby animals were born in the past few days .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	People need the telephone not only for chatting , but also for exchanging information in a very short and direct way with the possibility to answer immediately .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When I was a child , we had no telephone at home , and I always had to go to a phone box in the centre of our village .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	Now I have my own flat , and the first piece of furniture I 've bought was the telephone .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Who of you could imagine life without the telephone ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in for a moment ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Not being able to lie to your mother-in-law and pretend you ca n't attend her garden party because of an illness , without having to look her in the eye ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone , he had no idea of how popular it would be one day .
0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Its first appliance was in order to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	Nowadays , however , the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one could imagine life without it .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Life definitely would n't be the same without the invention of the telephone .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We use it daily in order to get information or to pass it on .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Just try to spend one week without using a telephone at all , and you will see that it is impossible to do so .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	So do n't take the telephone for granted , but keep in mind that our modern way of life is mainly due to its invention .

1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	The invention without no doubt , that has affected my own life by far is the car .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Picture this : a big city such as London or New York with no cars on their streets .
1	0	0	0	0	Could you imagine it ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	To be honest , I ca n't .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Cars are part of our daily lives .
0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	Traffic jams make people nervous , sometimes really upset and violent .
0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	But , anyway , people use cars .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	If we do n't use them we suffer from them .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In my case I use public transport during the week to go to work but I could hardly imagine my weekends without my beloved car .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	I really need it to escape from the pollution , mainly caused by cars and any other four-wheel motored vehicle .
0	0	0	1	0	Is n't that contradictorious ?

0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	Lots of great inventions has been invented in order to make people live comfortablely .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If you ask me which is the greatest invention of all , I will say that it is the television .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	" Televisions is just an amazing invention . "
0	0	0	0	0	0	My good friend said that .
0	0	0	0	0	I agree with her .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	Firstly , televisions make us know more about the world without travel it all .
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	If there are no televisions , we wo n't know what are the other countries like , or even what language they speak unless we go to that country .
0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secondly , for some points , it can educate young children .
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	Many TV programmes are especially made for children , such as " Learn follow me " and " Be good to others " .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Actually , they are quite good programmes and helped me know what I should do generally or how to behave nicely when I was still a child .
1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	The last but not least , it is a good kind of entertainments .
0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Maybe you will think that playing basketball , going to cinemas and discos are much better that staying at home sitting in front of an object .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	However , televisions can bring you the fun that other activities ca n't .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If sometimes I do n't want to go out and I do n't want to be lonely , that 's easy , just turn on the television and enjoy myself .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	However , everything has its advantages and disadvantages .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	Personally , I do think televisions is the most important invention .
0	0	0	0	Dear Maria Smith ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all , the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel .

0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	At the end of the conference , there will be a dinner in a luxurious restaurant so people must have nice clothes ; jean 's is not allowed .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Next to the restaurant , there is a disco for people who like dancing .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We can visit the old castle or the painting museum too .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I find television the most important invention .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think it 's good for old people because some of them cannot go to the cinema anymore .
1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	In one hand it 's because they have not enough money to pay it and in the other hand it 's because they ca n't move very well for example if they are disabled .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	With television , old people are less alone because most of old woman have not her husband anymore .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	Television is a good way to be informed with the news .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	I prefer being informed by television than by newspapers , it 's more relaxing .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think television is a good invention for children when they have free time and while they are watching television , we do n't have to look after them if we have something important to do .

0	0	1	0	0	0	The telephone a very important invention
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	In my early childhood my mother said to me that when she has been a litte girl there has been only one telephone in the house where she had lived .
0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	It has been in her parents ' appartement .
0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The neighbours had come into to make their calls and to get their calls .
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Todays nobody could imagine such a situation .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	In every household there is a telephone at least .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	There are a lot of advantages for it .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	Firstly people are able to talk to person on every time .
1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	Be it : just for fun or also to discuss some important and relevant thins .
0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	Moreover we always can call for help to the police , to the hospital or to a doctor .
0	0	0	1	0	This could save life !
1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	An other advantage is that all offices , firms and industries could not further exist without it .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Of course there is also a big disadvantage .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All people know this situation ; people want not to be interrupted , maybe they are reading a book , having a good talk or are having a little sleep ... then the telephone rings ... !
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	It is not an easy desicion how to react now .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Being sincere , most of us would go to the telephone .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	Another point of disadvantage is that the mobile phones are ringing. everywhere and on every time .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Especially youngsters misuse this kind of invention .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	To sum up this invention is one of the most useful things .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It is always the same how to people use it or not and how people handle it .
0	0	0	0	0	Dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I read your letters and I 'm ready to help you .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The mobile phone has completely changed our lives , it is an instrument which I cannot imagine myself living without .
0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Apart from being in-fashion it is also a very helpful machine .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Do you remember that day when you got stuck in the middle of the road with your car which would n't work ?
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What would you have done in that moment without a mobile phone ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	You were at home in less than ten minutes just because you had a mobile phone with you , amazing , is n't it ?

1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	All over , the invention of this little device is a big plus for everyone .

0	0	0	0	Dear Mrs Smith ,
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	it is with great regret that I hear of Mr Brown 's illness , and hope to see him soon in an excellent health .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Nevertheless , I am both pleased and honoured to expect you and your group in the context of our international meeting .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We have made arrangements for you to stay at the Palace Hotel .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Furthermore , since it is located between the airport and our location , a bus shuttle has been organised to pick all our guests from the hotel to the conference room .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The end-of-conference party is to be held at the ' Royal Room ' of the hotel , which has an outstanding reputation for its quality and seriousness .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	Therefore , all guests will be asked to wear the corresponding clothes in order to be accepted .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As for the three hours of free time , I strongly suggest you to check-in your lugages at the airport and then , after a five-minutes bus ride , spend your time in the marvellous ' Old City ' .
0	0	0	Best Regards ,
0	0	0	0	0	My fair Mobile Phone .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	The technological revolution taking place today can be directly linked to the amazing evolution of our communication abilities throughout those last years .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The inevitable invention symbolizing this aspect in our ordinary life is , of course , the mobile phone .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	It is clear and irrefutable that the use of this invention has becomed a necessary condition in some professional activities .
1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	Trades , politicians and taxi drivers are but a few examples of such needs .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	However , the common man seems to ignore how important and useful a mobile phone becomes , when in the hands of a high-school student .
0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	It becomes then a real obsession for the average students , as e uses it before the lessons , during the lessons , during lunch and , especially , during examinations ...
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	Nevertheless , it is also a common mistake to believe that the sole purpose of such an usage is to communicate information during an exam , since its major role is actually to allow the student and the parents to discuss during everyday 's courses .
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Bottom line is that any teacher complaining about this situation should confiscate not the student 's phone , but his parents ' !
0	0	0	Dear Madam ,
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I received your letter and I 'm pleased to answer your questions .

0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	Before the time with computers , people had to write every time a whole letter .
0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	When they would correct a word , they had to write the whole letter again .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	With the computer we can write a letter , correct a word or change the name without writting the whole letter again .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	We save the letter and in three week we could send it to another person .
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I work at a bank and I work all day with computers .
0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	If we hand't ay one , we had to write all the transactions on papers .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	If I order money for our bank with the computer I can be sure that I will arrive the day after .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	But if I had to write a letter and to send it by post , the money will arrive two or three days after .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	I have never work without a computer , but if we had n't any we would it find normally .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	First of all the hotel is the Palace Hotel , 82 Regent Street , so that it is very easy to reach the conference .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	In fact you can take the bus number 3 ; as you can see , the bus stop is just in front of the hotel , then you can get off immediately after the church that you pass , on your right hand .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Secondly , we will have the party in the hotel at 8.00 o'clock and a buffet will be served at 8.30 p.m. It would be also possible to get some vegetarian food and drink cocktails free of charge .
0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	I would recommend your students to bring their Identity Card to prove their age .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	Finally , if I were you I would go shopping to the City Centre to spend your last hours .
0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	However , if you re interested in Archeology you should vitis the History Museum in Garden Square .

1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	I the last fourty years people seem to be completely addicted by using their own car .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	It is said that the majority of the citizens has got a car and unfortunately this is the reason why cities are getting more polluted .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	On the other hand , this kind of facility has made our life more comfortable and easy .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	In fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our family and carring lugguage and shopping bags .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	Cars are able to cover not only short distance but also can be used for long journey .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	However , I have to say that it has made people be lazy and at the same time stressed due to the traffic .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	On the other hand one of the main advantages is that we can save time and money as cars have long last and allowe us travelling quickly .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	That 's why I could n't image my life without it .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Some inventions are not regarded as great things even though the life without them cannot be imagined .
0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	People do not have the impression on important inventions any more , because they have been getting more popular and common .
0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	However , there is something which is still believed that it was an extreamly important invention .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	This is electricity invented by Edison .
1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	From my point of view , the reason why electricity is such an important invention is that most of machines , appliances and equipments which are used in modern times can be operated with only electricity , which makes people not to too much phisical labour .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	What is more , many inventions have been accelerated by electricity .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In my life , I use electricity in many different ways .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	It makes my life more convenient than that without it .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	To sum up , although people do not feel that electricity is a great invention any more , the fact that electricity is one of the most important inventions in the world will not be changed .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Cars are also more reliable than other types of transport .
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	You do n't have to wait on a bus stop on a cold and windy weather for a late bus , or being stuck on a train for an hour due to some railtrack repairs , you can just jump into a car , tune your radio onto your favourite station and have a plesant drive to your distanation .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Cars are even more important for emergency situations such as fire in a house or if somebody is critically ill .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Could you imagine if our police , doctors or fire-fighters had to get somewhere quickly on foot ?
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I do n't think I need to comment on this .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	From my personal experience I realised how it 's important to drive a car when I was living in Johanesburg in South Africa .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Johanesburg is a very dangerous place to live .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I could n't just go for a walk , it was too dangerous .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	There I soon realised that I had to learn how to drive if I wanted a quality life for my daughter and myself .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Since I passed my driving test I can not understand how I used to live without a car before .

1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	Hundred years before people could n't even use an electric lump not saying about a car or computer .
1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	They have intentions improved our life a lot since they had appeared , but not every one beleives it is really so .
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Some people say that many of important inventions in our live are not so good and useful as we have got used to see them .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Computers make everything much faster so everything is now based on computer systems .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	I think it would n't be possible to survive for us without an eclectric life .
0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	Because of shipbuilding development people could make all the geographical discoveries , and an automobile transport is undenyable neccecerity in our life .

0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	And some old toilets might look awlful .
0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	But in my recommendation , I think it would be nice for the students to come and see this building .
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	Because they will be able to learn and compare with the place in their country .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	As Wales is not modern like America , so the students will probably get the idea of looking back to the old things .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	If it rains , you can take bus 54 that stops in front of the college .

0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	In other words , almost all aspects of our lives today rely on computers .
1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	So I am sure from this that it is convincing enough to say that invention of computers is really important .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	From my personal experience , I can also say that a personal computer is also an amazing tool .

0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	I think that the best choise for you is to take the 234 bus .
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	The bus stop you should get off is called " The Green Man " .

0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	As it is widely known , lots of different and important things were invented during the 20th century , nevertheless I believe that the most important one is the computer .
0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	It is a fact , that the modern society have created the demand for the ability to cope with the vast amounts of information .
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	Taking it into consideration I would like to say that the computer is the priceless invention for an accountants , designers , engineers and so on and on .
0	1	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	Another point in favour is the possibility to connect to the Internet .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	It allows you to have all the necessary information " on your fingertips " .
0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Also not least importantly is the role of computers in the process of production in factories around the world .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	On the other hand there are some disadvantages .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	For instance a lot of children nowadays replace their real life with the virtual world , which computers create .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	Another drawback is that in industry computers replace people 's labour , which leads to the increasing of unemployment .
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	To conclude I would like to say that the goverments of all developed countries would n't have been so concerned about so-called " problem 2000 " if the computer had not been so important for the modern society .
